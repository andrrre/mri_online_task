# Project done by Andrii Parfenenko

####Sorry, don't have enough time to write unit test
I have never worked before with it, so I postponed this part

Also never before worked with Material so kinda strange code
with CSS styles and CSS-in-JS

Done:
1. Transfer styles from Figma to project
2. Add functionality to main buttons (except an additional menu with three dots)
